The makefiles of this program is from Impara 0.2, whose original README is retained below. 

You can follow same instructions as mentioned below to compile this program though I have tried only on Linux.

The cbmc used is version 4.5 and the name of executable generated after compilation is "check_wp".

Impara is a software model checker for C programs
with POSIX and WIN 32 threads.
The techniques behind Impara are described in the following paper:

- MacOS X

COMPILING
---------

Impara relies on
