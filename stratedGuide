Installation instructions:

You need to first download and compile CBMC 4.5 and Z3. 

To install CBMC:
CBMC 4.5 is available here: https://codeload.github.com/diffblue/cbmc/tar.gz/cbmc-4.5
You need to download and untar it.
Then execute following commands:
cd src
make minisat2-download

You can refer  "COMPILING" file for dependencies of CBMC (it requires XCode command-line utilities which is available at https://developer.apple.com/downloads/ as per "COMPILING" file).

To install Z3:
Download Z3 source available here: https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3
Unzip it and execute following commands:
python scripts/mk_make.py
cd build
make


Note that you need not install compiled binaries (i.e. command "make install") as we will link directly from above directories.

Once above two tools are built download our source code, unzip it and enter into src/ directory. 
Now edit config.inc file present in src/ directory and change the variables "CBMC" and "Z3" to point to above created CBMC and Z3 directories respectively.
After this run the command make.
If make command was successful a binary with name "check_wp" will be built in check_wp/ directory. 

To test any program pass the program to check_wp binary. For example, if I want to run if_sat1.c program then I will execute command "./check_wp ../../tests/if_sat1.c" within check_wp/ directory. (Since if_sat1.c is present in tests/ directory two level directory up I am passing ../../tests/if_sat1.c to check_wp).

All the test program are present in tests/ directory present in top level.

Let me know if you need any more information.
